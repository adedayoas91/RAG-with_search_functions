This is a test document to demonstrate local document upload functionality.

The Agentic RAG System now supports three modes of document ingestion:

1. Online Search - Fetches documents from the web using Tavily search
2. Local Upload - Loads documents from your local filesystem  
3. Both - Combines both online and local sources

This makes the system more flexible and allows you to:
- Use your own private documents
- Combine proprietary data with public sources
- Work offline with local documents only

Example use cases:
- Research with your own papers and notes
- Corporate knowledge base integration
- Personal document analysis
